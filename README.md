# gridsim
This project is an exercise in object-oriented programming. Patterns like facade, factory, and singleton are implemented.
The project is an Android app that builds a grid with information from a server. The grid will be composed of different pictures that can display their location and type when clicked on.

The above screenshot shows what the app looks like. Were the server hosted by UNH running, the images on the grid would move around in accordance to the location provided by the server. When selected, an icon says it's state and location at the bottom. The button on the right would pause or resume the grid.
